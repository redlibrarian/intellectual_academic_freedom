          <aside class="notes">Article 19: Everyone has the right to freedom of
            opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold
            opinions without interference and to seek, receive and
            impart information and ideas through any media and
            regardless of frontiers.<br /> The UN Declaration enshrines
            a "politics of recognition" throughout its text, for example
            in the opening sentence of the preamble: "Whereas
            recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
            inalienable rights of the human family is the foundation of
            freedom, justice and peace in the world." We will see some
            of the assumptions and consequences of this politics of
            recognition later in this presentation.
          
            Coming out of Mill and classical liberalism, the social
            philosophy that underpins both intellectual and academic
            freedom can be characterized as individualism, the idea that
            the world is made up of self-sufficient, isolated,
            individuals who make their own choices, and idealism, the
            idea that what we think about things determines how things
            are.

            Both individualism and idealism commit us to particular
            political positions, and have particular political
            consequences.

          <h3>Framing: Academic Freedom</h3>

          <img src="img/ross.jpg" height="300" style="border:0"/>
          <aside class="notes">Like intellectual freedom,
          academic freedom was designed to protect people who were
          outside the dominant social classes (church and nobility) from
          the power of those classes. In historical terms, they were
          a bourgeois invention in order to support bourgeois challenges
          to the power of church and aristocracy. As the power of
          capital grew, academic freedom was also leveraged to protect
          against the power of the wealthy.
          
          Example: Christian Wolff (1679-1754) (offends
          the church in 1723) and Edward Ross (offended the Stanford
          family in 1900). The case of Ross is an interesting one, as
          Stanford's "first academic freedom case" was over Ross's
          racist and eugenicist views, but also over his criticism of
          the Stanford family's use of migrant labour (the two were
          obviously connected)</p>

        <section>
          <img src="img/galileo.jpg" height="400" style="border:0"/>
          <p>Galileo (1564-1642), held up as an ideal defender of academic
          freedom (Alfino 2014, 441).</p>
          <aside class="notes">
          Despite the "galilean ideal" of
          academic freedom (Alfino 2014, 441), intellectual and academic
          freedom do not draw a distinction between a neutral, objective
          search for truth one one hand and temporal power on the other.
          Rather, intellectual and academic freedom are weapons
          <em>in</em> the
          struggle for power between classes and groups. For example, it
          is important to remember that Galileo spent the rest of his
          life under house arrest. His "speaking truth to power" did not
          challenge power of the church in any material way, but
          idealism maintains that truth is sufficient to dislodge power.</aside>

          <aside class="notes">In the mainstream understanding of
          intellectual and academic freedom, the argument is that such
          freedom is necessary to achieve social justice. When looked at
          from the other perspective, it is tempting merely to reverse
          the argument and say that social justice must come first.
          However, it is more productive and more just to take a third,
          dialectical, approach, and say that intellectual freedom and
          social justice are not independent entities, but that we will
          only have intellectual freedom in any sense when we have
          social justice. In an unjust society, such as the one we live
          in, intellectual freedom is impossible. From this perspective,
          the struggle for social justice is the struggle for
          intellectual freedom. However, to take this approach means we
          must abandon the individualistic and idealistic assumptions
          that underpin the dominant conceptions of intellectual
          freedom. What are the arguments that we can make to do this?
          What would a sketch of the critique of intellectual freedom
          look like?</aside>
        </section>

          <img src="img/schrader2.png" style="border:0"/>
          <aside class="notes">
            Schrader's view here is a common one in librarianship: that
            there was once a period of "good capitalism", but it has
            been twisted or distorted into something bad (which is why
            current capitalism needs to be described using adjectives). John Buschman
            takes this view in his theory of the public sphere, and Ed
            D'Angelo holds it in his book on "Barbarians at the Gates of
            the Public Library". When this is the presumption, then the
            solution to social ills is a return to this previous good
            form of capitalism, and what initially appears as
            progressive is exposed as conservative, if not reactionary.
            The individualism and idealism of the dominant view of
            intellectual freedom, which comes out of classical
            liberalism, the liberalism of white, patriarchal,
            heterosexual property owners, can only ever defend and
            upholds those interests, the interests of settler-colonial
            capitalism.

            The idealism makes itself apparent in the inability for
            defenders of this dominant view to recognize that there is
            anything other than "offense" or "wrong ideas". They are
            unable to see that settler-colonial, racial capitalism
            creates material harm, not just offense. We can see this in
            the murder of Black people by police, and in the history of
            residential schools, to take just two examples. The Black
            community is not just offended by murder by police, they are
            harmed by it. Indigenous peoples were not just offended by
            residential schools, they were harmed, and continue to be
            harmed, through inter-generational trauma. To teach
            transphobia in universities is not merely offensive to
            marginalized students, it actually harms them, as a 2011
            Egale climate survey on homophobia, biphobia, and
            transphobia in Canadian schools has shown. To move further
            with the critique, however, we have to unpick some of the
            particular political perspectives that underpin
            them.</aside>

          <h4>The Politics of Recognition and Its Critique</h4>
          <img src="img/coulthard.jpeg" style="border:0"/>
          <aside class="notes">As mentioned in relation to the UN
            Declaration of Human Rights, underpinning the Canadian
          conceptions of intellectual and academic freedom is the
          concept of a "politics of recognition" (Taylor 1992; Honneth
          1995; Tully 1995).</aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align: left">"A number of strands in
          contemporary politics turn on the need, sometimes the demand,
          for <em>recognition</em>... The demand for recognition... is
          given urgency by the supposed links between recognition and
          identity, where this latter term designates something like a
          person's understanding of who they are, of their fundamental
          defining characteristics as a human being." (Taylor 1992,
          25).</p>
          <aside class="notes">Like traditional conceptions of
   intellectual and academic freedom, the politics of recognition is
   based on individualism and idealism. It ignores questions of
   inequality and power. For example, recognition was for a long time
   the principle way of looking at Canadian settler/Indigenous
   relations. But this ignores the fundamental power inequality between
   the Canadian government and First Nations. Taylor's idealist
   conception of the politics of recognition presumes the mutual
   recognition between equals, but this is undermined by the very
   inequality that exists for Indigenous peoples in Canada  (Coulthard
   2014).
   
   In academic freedom terms, this same
     individualism and presumed equality comes into play when professors
     don't want to be accountable to their community. The dominant way
     of understanding intellectual and academic freedom (embodied in the
     First Amendment and the "galilean ideal") is as a protection
     against a transcendental power (the state, the church, etc), but
     the role these concepts play in the social relations of civil
     society are much less clear cut.</aside>

          <img src="img/monkman.png" style="border:0"/>
          <img src="img/boyden.png" style="border:0"/>
      
          <aside class="notes">
     Indigenous ways of thinking about
     accountability and responsibility are useful here. Think of the
     recent controversy around Kent Monkman's <em>Hanky Panky</em>
     painting, or the question of accountability as applied to Joseph
     Boyden. The corrosive individualism of liberal philosophy, which
     underpins mainstream conceptions of intellectual and academic
     freedom, refuse to recognize accountability and responsibility. And
     by extension, the politics of recognition is meaningless without
     such conceptions.</aside>
   </section>

   <section>
     <p style="text-align:left">"In the same way that Indigenous
     activism critiques mainstream social justice movements for their
     lack of longterm relationship building and their ethics devoid of a
     relationship to land, librarianship (even critical librarianship)
     lacks a rigourous understanding of relationality (defined roles in
     how we are related to each other) and reciprocity (who we are
     accountable to and responsible for) that characterized Indigenous
     perspectives on librarianship." (Loyer 2018, 145)</p>
     <aside class="notes">This applies not just to librarianship,
     but to intellectual and academic freedom as well. The conception of
     subjectivity Loyer describes is in sharp contrast to the
     individualistic conception of identity deployed by Taylor (and
     which comes out of the white, bourgeois, patriarchal tradition of
     liberalism).</aside>
   </section>

   <section>
     <h3>Where does this leave us?</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>These ideas of relationality and reciprocity are antithetical
         to capitalism and capitalism's formulation of intellectual and
         academic freedom.</li>
       <li>It's OK to have a <em>different</em> understanding of
         intellectual and academic freedom. It doesn't mean you are
         <em>against</em> them.</li>
       <li>Recognizing that absolute freedom doesn't exist is a starting
         point, not an obstacle or barrier.</li>
       <li>There was no <em>good moment</em> in settler-colonial or
         capitalist history we can return to. We have to move
         forward.</li>
     </ul>
     <aside class="notes">The idea that having a different understanding
       of intellectual freedom means being anti-intellectual freedom is,
       to my mind, an extreme oversimplification and, ironically, goes
       against the idea of intellectual freedom itself.</aside>
